        <p><i>K.DA</i> was our first foray into the more mainstream music scene, we had middling success with our main</p>
        <p>game soundtrack and extras, however with the rise in popularity of K-Pop not only as a genre but as a culture as well,</p>
        <p>we saw it fit to bring some of our characters into the limelight.</p>
        <hr class="temp">
        <h2>The Group</h2>
        <p>Our main iteration of <i>K/DA</i> features four champions that already exist in the main universe of the game, however, </p>
        <p>for this we gave them all new skins and a new story to come along with them.</p>
        <p>Our four girls are Ahri, Evelynn, Kai'Sa, and Akali. </p>
        <p>In terms of music, each character is voiced by a different person, with K-Pop girl group <i>(G)I-dle</i> and american Singer</p>
        <p>Madison Beer, all voicing and singing for the group.</p>
