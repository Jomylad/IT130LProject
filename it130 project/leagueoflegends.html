<br />
    <p><b><i>League Of Legends</i></b> is our MOBA game that has amassed over <b>150 MILLION</b> players</p>
    <p>We here at Riot believe that while we grew up with games we'd by at a store up front, install, and then play until the end credits rolled, </p>
    <p>then wait until the next massive expansion or till the next years iteration dropped, we don't feel that that pattern was the way to go with League.</p>
    <p>We wanted, and still do, want an experience that will grow and change within a matter of weeks at a time.</p>

<!--GAME DESCRIPTION-->
<div class="text-center">
    <h3>The Game Itself</h3>
    <p>For those unaware, <b><i>League Of Legends</i></b> (or LoL for short) is our Multiplayer Online Battle Arena video game that is both developed and published</p>
    <p>in house, with help from our studios accross the globe. </p>
    <p>The main game takes place on a 5 vs 5 map known as <i>Sumoner's Rift</i>, where each player takes control of a champion, </p>
    <p>a unique character with all their own abilities and skills, as well a backstories and lore.</p>
    <p>These champions are taken into a battle of strategy and skill, where the first team to take out the enemies nexus wins.</p>
    <p> To achieve this, there are numerous enemy and ally turrets that either protect or attack you, as well as a jungle full of</p>
    <p> monsters and animals to help you on your way to level up and accumlate the strength to take the enemy down.</p>
</div>

<!--BUSINESS STUFF: HOW MUCH MONEY WE MAKE AND HOW-->
<br />
<div class="text-center">
  <h3>Our Business</h3>
  <p>With LoL being one of the biggest games in the world, there is surefire profit within its veins, in fact, from our 15 million users</p>
  <p> in 2011, in a matter of 5 years, the user base shot up to over 100 million.</p>
  <p>With this large user base that only grows more over time, in 2021 alone we earned over 1.5 billion dollars in revenue, easily staking</p>
  <p> us in the top ten of the most popular free-to-play games currently on the market.</p>
